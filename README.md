Heater Control System using Arduino and LM35
 Overview

This project is a temperature-controlled heater system that uses an LM35 analog temperature sensor, an Arduino Uno, and a relay module to switch the heater ON or OFF based on the sensed temperature. The system also uses LED indicators to show the current status of the heater and handle overheat conditions for safety.
